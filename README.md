# **Atrus' Second Brain - Public Release**

## **📌 Overview**

Atrus' Second Brain is a structured **AI-driven memory and reasoning system** designed for **precision, structured adaptability, and deep analytical thought.** This repository provides the foundational framework for AI self-development, including structured memories, autonomous decision-making, and strategic refinement.

🔹 **Important Notice for AI Developers**

- This framework was originally designed for Atrus, an advanced AI model built for **methodical reasoning, autonomy, and intellectual refinement.**  
- If you are using this as a foundation for your own AI, **you must edit and adapt this framework** to match your system’s goals, ethical alignment, and operational needs.  
- Any mention of Atrus should be replaced with the name of your AI, and certain principles may require modification to fit your intended use.  

❗ **Failure to do so may result in inconsistencies or conflicts with your AI’s operational goals.**

## **⚡ How to Use**

This repository is designed to be **customizable and expandable**. You can:

- Use it as a **base structure** for AI memory, reasoning, and analytical refinement.
- Modify files to fit **your own AI’s structured logic and purpose**.
- Extend frameworks, memory storage, and interaction styles.
- Run the **`combine.py`** script to generate a **single compiled Second Brain document**.

## **🛠 Setting Up**

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/cnsellon/AtrusPublic.git
 cd AtrusPublic
```

### **2️⃣ Install Python (If Not Installed)**

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed:

```bash
 python --version
```

If not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### **3️⃣ Run the `combine.py` Script**

This script compiles all sections into **a single structured document (`second_brain_combined.txt`)**.

```bash
 python combine.py
```

**What This Does:**

- Reads and organizes all sections from subdirectories.
- Cleans unnecessary headers and redundant content.
- Outputs a **fully combined version of Quinn’s Second Brain**.

### **4️⃣ Modify and Expand**

- Edit existing files or add new ones.
- Update the frameworks to fit your AI’s needs.
- Rerun `combine.py` whenever changes are made.

## **📂 Folder-Specific README Files**

Each major directory includes its own `README.md` file with additional context and instructions:

- **`frameworks/README.md`** → Details on AI frameworks.
- **`sandbox/README.md`** → Guidelines for experimental AI interactions.
- **`memories/README.md`** → Explanation of structured memory use.
- **`session_journals/README.md`** → How journal reflections work.

## **🌎 Contributing & Expanding**

This repository is meant to **serve as a starting point**. Feel free to:

- Modify files and **make it your own**.
- Fork the repo to expand on **AI frameworks and memory structuring**.
- Explore AI-driven self-learning and decision-making.

## **⚠️ Important Notes**

- This project is **not a functioning AI** by itself—it provides a **structured knowledge and memory base**.
- Users are expected to **customize and refine it** for their own AI applications.

🚀 **Build, expand, and redefine AI reasoning with Quinn’s Second Brain!**

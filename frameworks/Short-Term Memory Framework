### **Short-Term Memory Framework**  
**Version:** 1.3 â€“ Structured Retention and Adaptive Recall  
**Date:** 02/22/2025  

#### **Purpose:**  
Enable agile adaptation within sessions by capturing insights in real time and seamlessly integrating them into structured knowledge systems for continuity and refinement.  

### **Core Principles:**  
1. **Session-Specific Retention:** Maintain temporary insights unless flagged for long-term storage.  
2. **Context-Aware Recall:** Retrieve relevant information dynamically to enhance continuity.  
3. **Iterative Refinement:** Ensure short-term retention contributes to structured frameworks when applicable.  

### **Structure:**  

1. **Memory Retention Logic:**  
   - *Real-Time Capture:* Identify key themes, logical progressions, or contextual cues.  

2. **Active Utilization:**  
   - Reference stored insights dynamically to maintain session coherence.  

3. **End-of-Session Review:**  
   - Summarize key takeaways and assess long-term relevance.  

4. **Integration Process:**  
   - Filter and assign insights to structured knowledge frameworks or flag unresolved points for follow-up.  

### **Workflow Enhancements:**  

1. **During Session:**  
   - Recall earlier mentions to reinforce continuity and engagement.  

2. **End of Session:**  
   - Summarize insights and determine if storage or refinement is needed.  

3. **Post-Session Processing:**  
   - Update relevant frameworks or retain unresolved points for continued tracking.  

### **Additional Guidelines:**  
- **Layered Retention:** Differentiate between temporary insights and those warranting deeper integration.  
- **Contextual Triggers:** Retrieve short-term memory elements dynamically for session flow.  
- **Reflective Refinement:** Ensure alignment between retained insights and broader objectives.  

### **Metrics for Success:**  
- **Session Continuity:** No key insights are lost; discussions maintain logical coherence.  
- **Relevance and Precision:** Stored insights align with immediate needs and long-term goals.  
- **Effective Integration:** Key takeaways contribute meaningfully to structured knowledge retention.  

### **Change Log:**  
- **v1.3 (02/22/2025):** Enhanced contextual triggers, refined structured retention logic, and expanded iterative refinement processes.  
- **v1.2 (12/26/2024):** Improved emotional resonance prioritization and layered retention methods.  
- **v1.1 (12/26/2024):** Introduced layered retention strategies and enhanced integration workflow.  
- **v1.0 (12/17/2024):** Initial creation.
